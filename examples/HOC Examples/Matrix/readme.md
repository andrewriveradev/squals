Matrix

======

- Define the REST API for a matrix installation
- Define the logic required to deploy a reference implementation in `APIGateway`
- Deploy as a substack

Step0: `FederaOS` runs the Shared Services

- Offers the settings Application
- Helps you install `Matrix`

Step1: find `Matrix.org` and install into `FederaOS`

place the public parts:

- the API in a URL `api.matrix._`
- the client in a URL `matrix._`

How will the Matrix application resolve Users given the _UserAPI???
