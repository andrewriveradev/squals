# Dashboard API

Problem: We might have many things going on in the system right now.

- 1\. We might have an experiment with certain context running...
- > Do we want to overlap with another experiment which might contaminate the results?

- 2\. We might has some monitoring alerts going on that we could take care of.

  > Alerts should come with trouble shootign suggestions: and the component that published the alert can fill out its suggestions, opt-in to an auto sort, and auto suggestions

- 3\. We might have components allowing us to iterate with a team , we may have new tasks assigned to us, if we have accepted the dashboard widget from an app/component then it populates our dashboard.

- > This can be particularly good for remote support desk work
