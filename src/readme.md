> Shareable Cloud Infrastructure

## Project Goals:

[ ] - 1\. Make Infrastructure Shareable

[ ] - 2\. Local Validation for fast feedback - think watchMode or similar style feedback

[ ] - 3\. As Cloud Independent as is Reasonable

## Note:

Shareable is different than Shared Cloud Infrastructure. In fact the shared infrastructure is what we aim to avoid. We want to live with cloud delegates that talk to all the things for me - I talk to my cloud.
